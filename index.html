                <h2>About</h2>
                <p style="text-indent: 30px;">I am Niranjan Simha D H, a 2nd-year BCA student at SDM College, Ujire,
                    and
                    an
                    artist deeply inspired by
                    Indian temple culture and the timeless wisdom of Shilpashastra — the traditional science of art,
                    sculpture, and architecture. My drawings reflect a personal journey of learning and devotion,
                    rooted
                    in
                    the sacred forms, patterns, and philosophies found in classical Indian.
                </p>

                <p>Through my work, I explore the symbolic language of temples, sacred geometry, and traditional
                    iconography. I aim to honor and reinterpret these traditions, keeping them alive in a modern
                    context
                    while staying true to their spiritual essence.
                </p>

                <p> Alongside my academic journey, I have a growing interest in Data Science and modern
                    technologies. I
                    am
                    fascinated by how data and analytics can uncover patterns, tell stories, and bring structure to
                    the
                    complexities of the modern world — much like the intricate order and symbolism found in temple
                    architecture.
                </p>

                <p> As a lifelong learner, I am constantly seeking knowledge, refining my artistic practice, and
                    deepening
                    my understanding of both the cultural and technological foundations that shape our times. For
                    me,
                    art
                    and technology are not separate, but complementary paths of exploration: one connects me to
                    ancient
                    wisdom and spiritual depth, while the other opens doors to modern innovation and insight.
                </p>

                <p>Art, for me, is not just a form of expression — it is a way of connecting to something greater, a
                    bridge
                    between the visible and the invisible, the past and the present. By combining my passion for
                    traditional
                    art with my curiosity for data science, I hope to create a unique narrative that reflects both
                    my
                    roots
                    and my vision for the future.
